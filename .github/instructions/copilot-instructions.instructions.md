# Project scope

Simple PayloadCMS site for a coffe shop. No ecom but table booking module with email auto reply. 

# Previous task

I will start simple by adding a simple collection for the opening hours. It should be a general information collection. Not a Page or post or any specific block type. I want to centralize the management of the opening hours to one place and add a page level block later potentially. 

So the collection will need some input fields per row. 

Field 1: Day range (simple text) e.g. Mon-Fri, Sat-Sun
Field 2: Opening time (time picker)
Field 3: Closing time (time picker)
Field 4: Is Closed (checkbox)

These 4 fields are one entry in the opening hours collection.
The collection should allow multiple entries to be created.

# New task
 
New collection. This time contact info and social media links. This is also intended to be potentially used more than one place on the site so a general collection makes sense.

Field 1: Phone number (text)
Field 2: Email address (text)
Field 3: Facebook URL (text)
Field 4: Instagram URL (text)
Field 5: Street address (text)
Field 6: City (text)
Field 7: Postal code (text)
