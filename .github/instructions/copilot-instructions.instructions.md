# Project scope

Simple PayloadCMS site for a coffe shop. No ecom but table booking module with email auto reply. 

# Instructions

- Use PayloadCMS best practice.

# Next task

New collection. This is a cafe/bakery so we will need a menu collection. This collection should have fields for item name, description, price, category (e.g., beverage, pastry, sandwich), and an image upload for each menu item. Also I want a drag and drop array field for adding allergens (e.g., nuts, dairy, gluten) associated with each menu item. 

RIght now we are only doing the data architecture.
