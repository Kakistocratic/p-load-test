# Next task

I need to create a block component meant to show Google Maps. Its not embedded, its using the Google Maps API to show a map with a marker at a certain adress. I have enabled Maps API and Maps SDK although I dont know if both are needed. Beyond that I dont know what fields are needed in the component. Please suggest a good set of fields for this component and create it. The styling all comes from the google map ID and since the API key is restricted to relevant APIs I would think we need to give Google at least the map URL for the longitude and latitude to show the map. And probably the API key. Beyond that I dont know what else is needed. Please suggest a good set of fields for this component and create it. Since the block component can be used on several pages its nice to have this be a global. Since Contact Info already exists I suggest just adding the neeeded fields to that object.
