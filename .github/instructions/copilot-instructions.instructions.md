# Next task

I am modifying an existing CTA component. I want to add a background image the same way hero components in this project implement it. The desktop layout will be an aspect ratio of 3:1 and mobile layout will be 4:5. This means using the ArtDirection component already in the project to offer two distinct uploads in the cms for this block component. 

Right now the button is also situated on the right. I want to bring that into the left side and flex end so it sits in the bottom left roughly. On desktop and mobile this is a single column layout so the button should be centered horizontally but aligned to the bottom of the component with some padding.
